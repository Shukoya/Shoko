# Shoko

Terminal ebook reader for EPUB files.

## What it does

- Scans common folders for EPUB files and shows them in a menu.
- Opens a specific file directly when a path is provided.
- Reads in split or single view with adjustable line spacing and themes.
- Provides a TOC sidebar, bookmarks, and annotations.
- Supports mouse selection for highlighting and annotation editing.
- Can download public-domain EPUBs from Gutendex.
- Optional Kitty inline image rendering (when supported).

## How it works

- `bin/start` runs the CLI and enters menu mode or opens a file directly.
- State lives in a single store; actions update state and selectors read it.
- Rendering is component-based and drawn through a terminal buffer with diff updates.
- Selection/highlighting uses recorded line geometry from the render pass.

## Usage

```bash
bundle install
bin/start
```
